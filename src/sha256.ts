 *
 * Operates on UTF-16 code units. Inputs containing astral-plane characters
 * (surrogate pairs) will compare correctly but you almost certainly want to
 * compare hex/base64 digests with this, where every character is single-unit.
 *
 * @param provided - The value supplied by the caller (often attacker-controlled).

 * @returns `true` if the two strings are byte-equal, `false` otherwise. Also
 * returns `false` if either argument is empty.
